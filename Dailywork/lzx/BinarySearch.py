'''
Binary Search
Step 1: Initialize 2 pointers, start at beginning of array, end at the end of the arrayã€‚
Step 2: Find the element at the middle of the 2 pointers
Step 3:If element at the middle is bigger than our goal, set end pointer to the middle
Step 4:If element at the middle is smaller than our goal,set start pointer to middle +1

eg. arrary:[1,2,3,4,5,6]
target = 6
